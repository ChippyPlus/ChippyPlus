# Hey there, I'm ChippyPlus 👋
I'm a software developer with a passion for building robust and efficient systems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the inner workings of computers or tackling a new low-level challenge.

---
## Languages & Tools I use

My primary passion lies with Kotlin because its the greatest thing ever  
I have an extreme love for Google Cloud Platform because its perfect (And the cheapest)
I'm also very comfortable with C++ but not used often ( I severely lack the knowelage on macos framworks) 
As for Python, let's just say it's a tool I use when I have to, the language that fucking twinks use

* Kotlin (My favorite! ❤️)
* C++
* Python (Useless)

## What I'm Interested In

My favourite parts of computer science are the low level implementations and system design of operating systems!!!
